MA3K7 Assignment 1
24 January 2024

This assignment aims to tackle the problem of a 'number bracelet' and its patterns and various possibilities.
The problem is as follows: 
" Bracelets

  Start with any two numbers less than 10.
  For example, 1 and 5.

  Make a ‘number bracelet’ like this:
  1 → 5 → 6 → 1 → 7 → 8 → 5 →

  Continue this chain – what happens?

  How many different bracelets are there?
"


Below is Python code I used to help me solve this problem. Find the rubric of my full solution as a pdf saved as 'U*******_MA3K7_Assignment_1.pdf'.


#import libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random

#randomly generate the first two numbers between 0 and 9
x_1 = random.randint(0,9)
x_2 = random.randint(0,9)

print(x_1,x_2)

#begin the chain by adding the randomly generated numbers
arr = []
arr.append(x_1)
arr.append(x_2)

#choose the length of the chain, n
#create the chain as an array

n = 75
for i in range(2,n):
    arr.append((arr[i-1] + arr[i-2])%10)

print(arr)

## Maybe we can plot a graph to visualise the chain

xpoints = list(range(n))
plt.plot(xpoints,arr)
plt.title("For x_1="+ str(x_1)+ " and x_2=" + str(x_2))
plt.show()

#finding the index at which the chain begins to repeat
for i in range(2,n-1):
    if arr[i]==x_1 and arr[i+1]==x_2:
        print("The chain with x_1 = "+str(x_1)+" and x_2 = "+str(x_2)+" repeats at index "+str(i)+" i.e. position "+str(i+1))



## Now let's start to explore patterns between bracelets

#what happens when you switch the order of the first two random numbers
arr1 = []
arr1.append(x_2)
arr1.append(x_1)

for i in range(2,n):
    arr1.append((arr1[i-1] + arr1[i-2])%10)

print(arr1)


#printing all possible starting combinations (into a single array for neatness though not necessary)
#to find total number of possible combinations
all_arrs = []
for i in range(10):
    x_1=i
    
    for j in range(10):
        
        x_2=j
        
        arr = []
        arr.append(x_1)
        arr.append(x_2)

        l = 2
        for i in range(2,l):
            arr.append((arr[i-1] + arr[i-2])%10)

        all_arrs.append(arr)
        
print(all_arrs)
print("The number of possible combinations is: " + str(len(all_arrs)))
